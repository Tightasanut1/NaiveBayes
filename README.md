# NaiveBayes
Over summer 2018, as a code excercise and to develop my understanding of machine learning theory I wrote a Naive bayes classification algorithm. 

The Naive Bayes classifier gets its name from the assumption that all predictor variables are independent - conditional on the outcome. This is an empirical simplification that greatly reduces the computational requirements and data requirements.

This code is written for python 3.6
